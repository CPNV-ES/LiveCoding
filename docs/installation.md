# Setup LiveCoding fo developpment

The LiveCoding platform is divided into 3 main parts :
* **The processor :** responsible to run the differents suported languages.
* **The client :** provide the code editor and the frame for the game.
* **The games :** provide the engine and the game runtime.

## Requirements

### Processor
* [Python 3.7.*](https://www.python.org)
* [php-cli ^7.0](http://php.net)
* [Ruby 2.3](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)

### Client
* [Node.js ^11](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Processor installation

## Client installation

The client app uses webpack to build and optimize the code.
Follow the steps to start development :

1. Move into the `client` folder : `cd client`
2. Installe the dependencies : `npm install`
3. Run the development server : `npm run dev`
4. Open a browser on `localhost:8080`

You are ready to start writing code !
